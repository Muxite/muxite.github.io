    <h3>About Me</h3>
<div class="subsection" id="default-open">
    <h5>Who am I?</h5>
    <p>I am a 17 year old attending UBC Vancouver for Applied Science (Engineering). I hope to major in Computer Engineering. 
    I have a diverse range of projects, from purely software, to Arduino, RC planes, and 3D printing/design.
    I use Fusion 360 for CAD. I led an engineering club for my last 2 years of High School. I enjoy K-pop, Taylor Swift music, City Pop, J-pop, and Mandopop.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I speak English and Thai (but I can't read Thai) and am learning Mandarin/Chinese (HSK 3). I also know American Sign Language (took ASL 25).</p>

<h3>Main Python Projects:</h3>
<p>My Python projects typically involve webscraping, image manipulation, or computer vision</p>
<br>
<ul>
    
    <div class="subsection" id="default-open"><h5>AutoSpotCV</h5><p>Various computer vision scripts, with face detection and recognition,
         as well as scripts for downloading training data off the internet. WIP, it's my biggest personal project.</p>

<h3>Unity Projects (C#):</h3>
<p>I use Unity for making simulations and sometimes games. I am often too ambitious with these projects (+ C# isnt my main language)</p>

<h3>Engineering Club Projects:</h3>
    <p>I cofounded and was president of this club at QEHS. It aimed to solve problems around the school and teach students skills, or help them find their passions.
        It was student-led and was initially pitched as the "solutions club" to design and build requests from teachers and other clubs. 
        Some projects failed, some succeeded, or laid the groundwork for someone else to persue. It was very funding focused, resource intensive, and time intensive. 
        I hope someone else will try this type of club at their school.

        <h5>GradBricks</h5>
        <p>Continued the school tradition of wall paintings for graduating students (but direct painting is banned by the school board).
            Set a precedent for future grad bricks, recieved 31 painted boards compared to the previous year's 7.</p> </div>
